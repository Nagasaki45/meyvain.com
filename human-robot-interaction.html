<h1>summary</h1>
<p>In this project, I aimed to further develop my understanding and gain experience with qualitative research as an academic practice. The study explores human experiences based on Human-Robot-Interaction approach. More specifically, this work examines the case study of surgeons performing Minimal Invasive Surgery (MIS) using the da Vinci robotic system. My findings demonstrate how human-centred anthropological approaches can be applied to the investigation of medical technologies.</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p><em>This project was conducted in 2019 as my MSc thesis in Digital Anthropology at University College London, awarding me with a Merit degree.</em>
<!-- This work was modified into an article for ALT.HRI for the IEEE Human-Robot-Interaction convention, Cambridge, UK 2020. --></p>
<p>The the da Vinci robotic systems is specifically designed for MIS composed by 3 components;  Surgeon Console, Vision Cart and Patient Cart. All of which part of a digital infrastructure that transformed MIS practice to the very core. With analogue tools left behind the surgeons manipulates the robot without ever touching the patient, sitting in the surgeon console with their hands operating the robot from a few meters away.</p>
<h1>Challenges</h1>
<ul>
<li>Exposure to a multidisciplinary literature, ranging from human-robot interaction, to advances in medical technology.</li>
<li>Potentially criticising a cutting edge technology.</li>
<li>Negotiating time constraints.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Methods</h1>
<ul>
<li>Semi-structured interviews with 6 surgeons.</li>
<li>Ethnographic field work in a specialised robotic assisted surgery department in West London, observing 6 minimal invasive surgeries.</li>
<li>Employing thematic analysis techniques by establishing a theoretical and raw data emergent codes to detect patterns in my data to be interrogated by theoretical frameworks.</li>
<li>designing and analysing qualitative questionnaires and data.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>The idea that humans enhance their lives and bodies using tools, extending their abilities and senses beyond their biological bodies, is a key concept explored in anthropology. Following cyborg anthropology practice that focuses on the connections between technologies and bodies (Gray et al., 1995), I decided to unfold surgeons’ experience using complex medical technology in three sections of my findings. First, ‘Isolation’, describes the system’s settings and impact on ergonomics, communication and sense of control of surgeons. Secondly, ‘Enhancement’, focuses on the ways in which the system enhances physically and cognitively the surgeons abilities and preferences. Lastly, ‘Immersive Qualities’, where I have offered my analysis on the system’s immersive qualities and its effects on surgeons experience while performing surgery. This includes analysis of a video-game, ’in the zone’, relaxing experience, with noticeable body and place illusion.</p>
<p>In this work, I have identified common experiences emerging from the interviews. The surgeons express a tension between ’interacting with’ the da Vinci robot and a feeling of ’being’ the robot. They sometimes discuss the robot as an external tool and at other times, think about it as an extension of their own body.</p>
<p>I conclude with a discussion on immersive qualities of the da Vinci robotic system as an instrument, and its impact on the users experience and practice.  </p>
