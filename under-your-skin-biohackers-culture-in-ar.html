        <h2>Under Your Skin: Biohackers culture in AR</h2>
    </header>

    <p><img class="image fit" src="images/fulls/under_your_skin_app_look.png"></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Anthropology is the study of humans wherever or whatever they might be doing, and is a discipline that faces ever growing challenges. This project aimed to contribute to the ongoing discussion regarding digital anthropology practice. This research follows from the notion that digital anthropology is not only the study of the 'digital', or technology mediated human experiences, rather a new platform to present, visualise and interact with ethnographic data and people's endeavours.</p>
<p>Conducted in 2019 as part of my practical digital anthropology project for UCL MSc.</p>
<p>In this assignment, I chose to research the Biohackers community in London. Particularly, my focus was on Biohacking subculture, involving RFID/NFC chip installation into the human body.</p>
<p>Questioning how emerging technologies create new opportunities to reframe the embodied experience of being human, challenging the limits and abilities of the human body, while experimenting with what 'being human' might look like in the future.</p>
<p>I believe digital anthropology is not only the study of the 'digital', rather, it is a new platform to present, visualise, and interact with ethnographic data.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creating an engaging form of demonstrating ethnographic data in an interactive way, without losing the complexity and context of the researched subculture and social phenomena.</li>
<li>Unpack anthropological research outside of an academic setting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>I decided to combine three methods to establish adequately varied data for me to work with. Therefore, I performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Field work ethnography on site (in a body art studio in south London)</li>
<li>Online ethnography (both in social media and specialised forums)</li>
<li>Interviews (with seven people, both in person and virtually)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>In order to unpack research in a digital sphere, I chose to incorporate both fiction and reality. I composed a conceptual website and an augmented reality (AR) app, that offers a thought-provoking scenario for viewers to interact with my findings.</p>
<p>So on one hand, I decided to simulate a fictional body art studio's online shop, where I aimed to keep the 'first person perspective', as the viewer conceptually assumes the standing point of my interviewees as clients. On the other hand, I present real input from my interviews to faithfully portray my research findings.</p>

<h3><em>Why an online shop?</em></h3>
<p>I had a conversation early on in the process of researching Biohacking phenomena with "S", the owner of the body art studio I conducted field site ethnography in. As a tattoo artist, he much preferred discussing his body art and tattoo designs, rather than discussing his biohackers clientele who would visit his studio to get "chipped up" with microchips implants in a sterile environment. The practice became well accepted in the community, compared to the early customs of installing the microchips at home in a DIY spirit that this community grew from. "S" seemed to be rather annoyed with my relentless interest in the microchips implants and the biohackersâ€™ customs than in his own body art and designs. Perhaps I posed one question too many, as at a certain point "S" turned to me and said: "it's just part of the catalogue".</p>
<h3><em>Why AR?</em></h3>
<p>In all the interviews for this project, the curiosity about future technology and its impact on the human body was profoundly present. Incorporating AR was a matter of looking for a creative and imaginative solution to a question of how to present my interviewees answers regarding a future that does not yet exist. For instance, I wanted to explore their view on the future of their practice, and what they would like their biohacking abilities to be able to conjure if their wildest dreams were possible.</p>
<p>Combining the idea of the catalogue with discussion about future technology led me to turn to AR: it was a way I could present a discussion about a future, as it came up in my ethnographic data, in an interactive form. This led me to create a conceptual prototype that could combine the existing human body, future imaginative impact, and an ongoing trend in retail of incorporate AR in many online cutting-edge customer experiences.</p>
<p>In each possible "future" scenario, which could be found in the "Coming soon?" section, I added some points for future contemplations. These include references to scholars who wrote about possible future paths, the physical constraints of biohacking, companies who are currently dedicating to such development, or thought-provoking questions regarding these very practices.</p>
