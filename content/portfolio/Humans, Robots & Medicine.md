This is a collection of teasers from my MSc essays, where I write with different theoretical and practical frameworks on the meeting place of the human body, medical technology, and the interaction between humans and machines.

#1. **mHealth**
##Mobile technologies and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on healthcare systems.

This essay is my attempt to explore the health sector adoption of mobile technologies (mHealth) and their use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Submitted as part of the ‘Anthropologies of Science, Society and Biomedicine’ module at UCL.

Smartphones and smart technologies change the way we think about health and the possibilities of healthcare profoundly. AI-related health start-ups have experienced a massive increase in funding and investor interest. By 2021, growth in the AI market is expected to reach $6.6 billion (Collier, M., et al. 2017). Even companies that are not traditionally linked with healthcare, such as Google and Amazon, are increasing their involvement in this sector.

In this work, I offered a comparative analysis of two companies aiming to disrupt the health care market by pursuing a business model based on AI and mHealth. Offering AI based infrastructure managed by usable mobile interface for their users to choose a new way of accessing healthcare in the UK.

Discussing the adoption of AI in medicine, AI framework and challenges, employing the notion of human augmentation as a framework which could help to incorporate practices such as mHealth apps and AI based systems into healthcare infrastructures.

#2. **Healthcare Robots**


This essay intended to explore the adoption of healthcare robotics for elderly care as a means to overcome healthcare’s ever-growing burden. This work was dedicated to analyse a current trend and to critically engage in a complicated commentary discussion. Submitted as part of Digital Anthropology core modules at UCL.

Using a well established division, demonstrated in the Broadbent, Stafford & MacDonald (2009) Healthcare Robots Review, I offered three case studies; [1] physical assistance robot, [2] companionship robot, [3] monitor health and safety robotic system.

Offering an analysis and elaborating on the market's growing tendency of exploring social challenges by turning to technological solutions, could promote better policy and investments prospects in order to deal with the global phenomena we are to face.



#3. **Can a robot even be human?**

This work was dedicated to exploring a philosophical experiment in an academic setting. Where many might consider such questions as impractical or even meaningless existential contemplations, I see them with profound impact potential, and perhaps not coincidentally, one of the best topics to research.

In this essay, I attempted to join the anthropological conversation on human-machine interaction by exploring the idea of human-robot as a dichotomy, offering two main examples: cyborgs and humanoids. I chose to employ research by a digital anthropologist called Tom Boellstorff, and the philosophical work of John R. Searle on machine consciousness.

Tom Boellstorff wrote on the need to challenge the blurring dichotomy between the online and the offline narrative which so commonly accompanies ideas of human and technology. The line between the virtual and the actual, claims Boellstorff, is not blurring - the gap between the two is vital (Boellstorff, 2012). He gives an analogy of binary computer logic and argues that just as 0s and 1s, which form the whole computer language, do not fuse into one another, the digital and the physical similarly do not collapse and form an indistinguishable blurred new reality.

Boellstorff suggests that "this distinction is not limited to virtual worlds" (2013, p.50). With this thought-provoking idea, I decided to explore robots and humans as dichotomies, similarly aiming to challenge the idea of blurring. I examined anthropological works surrounding two phenomena: cybernetics’ challenge to the human experience with mechanical augmentation, and the emphasis on humanoids and A.I development in robots creation.

John R. Searle is an American philosopher arguing that the human experience is grounded in the biological body. Experience is inherently bound to consciousness, he claims: "Although consciousness is a biological phenomenon it has some important fetchers that other biological phenomena do not have. The most important of these is what I called its 'subjectivity'" (1993, p.310-311).

Following Searle philosophy, if the human experience, consciousness is inherently situated in the body, following such logic, if the biological and the non-biological are fundamentally different while embodied subjectivity is the core of experience, I believe that a robot will never be a human as he is not embodied in the human body, rather might develop, with time, a different kind of consciousness and experiences that will be situated in the non-biological robotics realm, with its different sensory mechanism, history, consciousness and sense of self.
