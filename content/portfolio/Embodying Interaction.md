# Background

In this project I aimed to further develop my understanding and gain experience with qualitative research as an academic practice.
It explores technology mediated human experiences based on human-robot interaction approach.
More specifically, this work examines the case study of surgeons performing minimal invasive surgery (MIS) using the da Vinci robotic system.
It demonstrates how human-centred anthropological approach can be applied to the investigation of medical technologies.

<!-- The the da Vinci robotic systems is specifically designed for MIS composed by 3 components;  Surgeon Console, Vision Cart and Patient Cart. All of which part of a digital infrastructure that transformed MIS practice to the very core. With analogue tools left behind the surgeons manipulates the robot without ever touching the patient, sitting in the surgeon console with their hands operating the robot from a few meters away. -->

# Challenges

- Exposure to a multidisciplinary literature, ranging from human-robot interaction to advances in medical technology.
- Coming from anthropology and finding my way into the field of medical technology.
- Criticising a cutting edge technology.
- Dealing with time constraints.

# Methods

- Semi-structured interviews with 6 surgeons.
- Ethnographic field work in a specialised robotic assisted surgery department in West London, observing 6 minimal invasive surgeries.
- Employing thematic analysis techniques by establishing a theoretical and raw data emergent codes to detect patterns in my data to be discussed in an academic fashion.

# Solution

The idea that humans enhance their lives and bodies using tools and extend their abilities and senses beyond their biological bodies is one of the main themes explored in anthropology.
Following cyborg anthropology practice that focuses on the connections between technologies and bodies (Gray et al., 1995) I decided to unfold surgeons experience using such a complex medical technology in my findings in three sections.
First, Isolation, describes the system’s settings and impact on ergonomics, communication and sense of control of surgeons.
Secondly, Enhancement, focuses on the ways in which the system enhances physically and cognitively the surgeons abilities and preferences.
Lastly, immersive qualities, were I have offered my analysis on the system’s immersive qualities and its affects on surgeons experience while performing surgery, including a video-game, ’in the zone’, relaxing experience, with noticeable body and place illusion.

In this work I have identified some common experience emerging from the interviews.
The surgeons expresses a tension between ’interacting with’ the da Vinci robot and a feeling of ’being’ the robot.
In other words, they sometime discuss the robot as an external tool and sometime think about it as an extension of their own body.

I conclude with a discussion on immersive qualities of the da Vinci robotic system as an instrument based on digital infrastructure.
