# Background

Exploring processes of knowledge sharing and practices adaptations of volunteer coders at ‘The Public Knowledge Workshop’.

Conducted in 2013 for my BA in Sociology and Anthropology for the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

This work had taken place as part of a course at Professor Amalia Oliver's class “entrepreneur innovation and networks”. It was in her classes that  I was first encouraged to ask and explore the role of technology in society. Under Professor Oliver's supervision, I wrote my dissertation on a non profit volunteer programmers dedicated for information accessibility and government transparency, The 'Public Knowledge Workshop'. Their model was based on volunteers who aimed to employ their programming knowledge, to hack their way, for their vision of a better society.


# Challenges

* New volunteers every week in a wide range of coding skill (usually having very little to non past experience collaborating on code based projects.)
* A large number of drop-outs (creating a challenge for experienced volunteers. Either devoting time and energy to help and adopt newcomers or aiming to get progress on the project with the current team or get progress individually as the most experienced and capable coders as project leaders?)
* fluid organisational structure


# Methodology

Over a period of six months, I combined four methods of data collection. Firstly, I used field site ethnography in a variety of locations where the volunteers worked and gathered, such as the Google campus on their Tel-Aviv branch among others. Secondly, I conducted semi-structured interviews with nine volunteers ranging in gender, rank and region. Thirdly, I analysed official documents published on the organisation's website, particularly around volunteer adoption protocols. Lastly, I extrapolated from GitHub all volunteers’ code sharing and statistically analysed the patterns of adoption and drop-out of new volunteers.

# Findings

My research shed light on three main areas:
1. There is an underline cause for dropping out volunteers as ‘The Public Knowledge Workshop’ is a known place to be recruited by tech companies looking for juniors roles with coding skills.  
1. The fluid managing structure is not suitable for such organisation. Where the most tech savvy, valuable coders being otherwise engaged in a non-technical tasks such as welcoming the newcomers and explaining the organisations framework.

# Suggested solutions

1. Aim for non-technical personas to enter as volunteers as coordinates and project managers.
1. Invest in a learning source for newcomers.
1. Create a work repository, level based, task managers. Where project leader could share tasked based on technical skills.
1. Aim for a meeting on a regular bases to discuss the project and future goals.

The work was very well received, and I graduated with distinction.


# Results

Using my data collection, analysis and findings I was able to uncover new volunteers struggles and the impediments in the knowledge-sharing practices that were leading to an astonishing amount of dropouts,  leading to inevitable exhaustion of personal and resources.
By help the organisation improve their volunteer's adaptation practices, I created a valuable impact not only on the organisation goals rather on potential healthier user-government interaction.
