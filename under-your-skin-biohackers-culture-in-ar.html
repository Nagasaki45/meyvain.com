        <h2>Under Your Skin: Biohackers culture in AR</h2>
    </header>

    <p><img class="image fit" src="images/fulls/under_your_skin_app_look.png"></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Anthropology, being the study of humans wherever or whatever they might be doing, is facing as a discipline ever growing challenges. Not only regarding the vast amount of new technological phenomena that are exponentially growing, rather the ability to study such human experiences with the right methodology, environments and tools for ethnography to be gathered, where research could be developed and cultural knowledge would be fairly portrayed.</p>
<p>This project aimed to contribute to this ongoing discussion regarding digital anthropology practice. Joining the notion that <strong>digital anthropology is not only the study of the 'digital', or technology mediated human experiences, rather a new platform to present, visualise and interact with ethnographic data and people's endeavours.</strong></p>
<p>Conducted on 2019 as part of my practical digital anthropology project for UCL MSc.</p>
<p>In this assignment I took upon myself to research the Biohackers community in London, England. Particularly Biohacking subculture involving RFID/NFC chip installation into the human body.</p>
<p>Emphasising on the sociality aspects of the Biohackers practice, community shaping online (locally and worldwide), and body perspectives. Questioning how emerging technologies creates new opportunities to re-frame the embodied experience of being human, challenging the limits and abilities of the human body while experimenting with what might 'being human' looks like in the future.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creating an engaging form of demonstrating ethnographic data in an interactive way without loosing the complexity and context of the researched subculture and social phenomena.</li>
<li>unpack anthropological research outside of an academic setting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>methodology</h2>
<p>I decided to combine 3 methods to establish adequately and varied data for me to work with. Therefore I preformed:</p>
<ul>
<li>field work ethnography on site (in a body art studio in south London)</li>
<li>online ethnography (both in social media and specialised forums)</li>
<li>interviews (with 7 people both in person and virtually)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>In order to unpack research in a digital sphere, I choose to incorporating both fiction and reality as I composed a conceptual website and an augmented reality (AR) app that offers a thought provoking scenario for viewers to interact and engage with my findings.</p>
<p>So on one hand I decided to simulate a fictional body art studio's online shop, where I'd aimed to keep the 'first person perspective', as the viewer takes conceptually the standing point of my interviewees as clients. And on the other hand, I present real input from my interviews to portray faithfully my research findings.</p>
<p>You are welcome to visit the Under your Skin project's <a href="https://meyvain.wixsite.com/underyourskin">website</a> and watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xh1R7xtPp8">YouTube video</a> that demonstrate the experience from the view point of a biohacker costumer browsing through the catalogue and the AR app to think about future human augmentation.</p>

<h3><em>why an online shop?</em></h3>
<p>I had a conversation quite early on in the process of researching about Biohacking phenomena with "S", the body art studio owner I have done my on field site ethnography in. He, as a tattoo artist, much preferred to discuss his body art and tattoo designs than his biohackers clientele who would visit his studio to get "chipped up" with microchips implants in a sterile environment. A practice that became well accepted in the community compered to the early days costumes of installing the microchips at home in a DIY spirit this community grow from. "S" seemed to be rather annoyed with my relentless interest in the microchips implants and the biohackers costumes than in his own body art and designs. Perhaps one question was one too many as at a certain point "S" turned to me and said: "it's just part of the catalogue".</p>
<h3><em>Why AR?</em></h3>
<p>In all the interviews for this project the curiosity about future technology and its impact on the human body was profoundly present.
Incorporating AR was a matter of looking for a creative and imaginative solution to a question of how to present my interviewees answers regarding a future that is not yet exist. For instance, their view on the future of their practice and what they would like their biohacking abilities would be able to conjure if all their most wild dreams where possible.</p>
<p>Combining the idea of the catalogue with discussion about future technology led me to turn to AR as a why I could present a discussion about a future as it came up in my ethnographic data in an interactive form.
Leading me to create a conceptual prototype that could combine the existing human body, future imaginative impact and an on going trend in retail of incorporate AR in many online cutting edge costumer experiences.</p>
<p>In each possible "future" scenario, which could be found in the "coming soon?" section, I added some points for future contemplations. From referencing scholars who wrote about possible future paths, physical constraints, up-to-date companies who are dedicating to such development or a thought provoking questions regarding such practice.</p>
