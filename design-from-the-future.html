<p><em>This project was conducted in 2019 as a practical showcase for the Design Anthropology module, as part my MSc in Digital Anthropology in University College London.
To practice design anthropology "in the wild" this project combined real world clients, ethnography based research, conceptual design deliverable and presentation.</em></p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>As part of a group of 3 students I was paired with the materials design startup and consultancy <a href="https://ourownskin.co.uk/">Our Own Skin</a>. They are conceptual visionary designers that, at the time, were on the process of developing their brand in the field, working on their conceptual designs while figuring out their business strategy and goals.</p>
<p>Our Own Skin were interested in, among other things, "new" materiality: products made from the body / bio / grown materials.
We were tasked to help them getting better understanding of trends around body augmentation in the industry as well as possible cultural adoption of "new" materiality designs.</p>
<h1>Challenges</h1>
<ul>
<li>Improve clarity and help focusing the designers' wide range of interests and projects.</li>
<li>Our Own Skin were looking to overcome the limited availability of human grown materials and find ways to incorporate biomaterials in their designs. However, innovative biomaterials or "new" materiality is a relatively new and undeveloped field, where human extracted materials (i.e. human bi-products turned into materials) or grown materials are not widely used.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>In order to create a unique value proposition for Our Own Skin and to further help them build their brand and a clear narrative to land successfully as a niche player in the design consulting market our project focused on the human body for we created an initial data base for further growth and clarity workshop.</p>
<p>In order to create conceptual designs around body materials / body conceptual designs, we gathered ethnographic data to work shop together with our clients. Creating a conceptual ideas generator, games for innovating designs and passing along a data base for initial work on new concepts and a foundation to grow from.</p>
<p>To address these objectives, we proposed to begin by gaining an understanding of people’s perceptions around the body and the relationship of the body with materials in different sectors and professions.</p>
<p>The focal point of the research was to collaborate with people within selected communities to gain a holistic understanding of how they understand their bodies. Based on an empathetic understanding of people’s relationships with their bodies we will be able to develop target spaces and insights that will help develop an authentic positioning for the client to grow.</p>
<p>together with the clients we established 3 targeted areas for exploration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sports (performance)</li>
<li>Health &amp; Wellness (function)</li>
<li>Fashion (adornment)</li>
</ol>
<p>From each category we had found a representative, who we later on conducted ethnographic session with gathering our core data base.</p>
<h1>Deliverable</h1>
<h2>I. Workshop</h2>
<ol>
<li>show study cases and analysis</li>
<li>priority pyramid exercise</li>
<li>clarity generator exercise</li>
</ol>
<h2>II. Game: Design From the Future.</h2>
<p>Our own original adaptation on the popular design game <a href="http://situationlab.org/project/the-thing-from-the-future/">"The Thing From the Future”</a>. The Design From the Future game was made to function either as part of the creative process of coming up with new designs and conceptual areas for exploration or integrated as part of the clients own workshops they run as a consultancy.</p>

<p>The Design game combines the clients needs, prospective areas of exploration and designs constraints. For instance, a workshop could be attended on how to combine different body parts to be designing for with a specific material in question.</p>
<h2>III. Analysis</h2>
<p>Data sheet analysis for the clients to work with initial insights on possible cultural adoption of "new" materiality designs and body perspectives.</p>
