        <h2>Coders Adaptation</h2>
    </header>

    <p><img class="image fit" src="images/fulls/laptop-codes.jpg"></p>
<p>Exploring processes of knowledge sharing and practices adaptations of volunteer coders at The Public Knowledge Workshop using ethnographic methods.</p>
<p>conducted in 2013 for my BA in Sociology and Anthropology for the Hebrew university in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>This work had taken part of a course at Professor Amalia Oliver's class “entrepreneur innovation and networks”. A place where I was encouraged, for what felt like the first time in my life, to ask and explore the role of technology in society. Under Professor Oliver's supervision I wrote my dissertation on a non profit volunteer programmers dedicated for information accessibility and government transparency, The Public Knowledge Workshop. Their model was based on volunteer who aimed to employ their programming knowledge and interest to learn to hack their way, for what they believe, is a better society.</p>
<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>Over a period of 6 month I combined 4 methods of data collection. First, field site ethnography in a variety of locations where the volunteers work and gathered, such as Google campus on their Tel-Aviv brunch among others. Second, semi structured interviews with 9 volunteers ranging in gender, rank and region. third, I analysed official documents published in the organisation's website, particularly around volunteers adoption protocols. Lastly, I extrapolated form GitHub all volunteers code sharing and analysed statistically the patterns of adoption and drop out of new volunteers.  </p>
<p>The work was very well received and I graduated with distinction.  </p>
